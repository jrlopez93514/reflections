When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with a group of individuals on the same project and need to exchange work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not be ready to accept new changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of branch on GitHub. A clone is a copy of a branch either remote or local.
A branch is a name given to a particular repository instance.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to do merges locally before pushing changes remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Collaboration would have to be done through direct contact. It would be harder trying to contact a person
who was extremely difficult to get a hold of.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

When you aren't sure about whether the change will inadvertantly affect the master branch.
Making changes in master has the advantage to allow quick turn around but using a branch
allows opportunities for collaboration.
