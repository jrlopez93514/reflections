When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with a group of individuals on the same project and need to exchange work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not be ready to accept new changes.
